# Setup python virtual environment( setup_python_venv )

This script was done to help setup the python virtual environment during
the dev stage. During the initial stage of development the requiriments
change a lot until you find the heart library.

Once upon we pass this stage, eventually the requirements will
change and the pip will not clean the old requirements for you, pip is
your friend not your mommy. This program will help to keep the house
clean. Enjoy yourself :P
